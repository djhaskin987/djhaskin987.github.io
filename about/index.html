    <p>I have a gorgeous wife and three kids: two daughters and one son.  I
    enjoy reading man pages, novels, web pages, and the occasional academic
    paper. My hobby is my profession; it is difficult to tell sometimes why I
    am doing something, whether because I am paid or because I enjoy it.</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m really good at solving problems involving unfamiliar technologies.
    Often when building or deploying software, the devil is often in the
    details. I am good at clearing away the obstacles surrounding the release
    of a product and creating a maintainable, scalable pipeline so that the
    product can move through to production or release.</p>
    <p>I am deeply passionate about getting things done the right way. I work
    hard on keeping up to date on the greater community and try to find better
    ways of fixing problems at work. I am active in the open source community
    and I value working with open source developers and tools. I am also quite
    happy to use proprietary software when the need arises.</p>
    <p>I am self-motivated and I work hard. I am also a solid team player,
    willing to help newer team members ramp up and also to serve as a solid
    resource for my teammates who are more experienced. I really appreciate
    direction and mentoring from good leaders. I am passionate for contributing
    to group efforts and doing my part for the win.</p>
    <p>I like taking pride in my work and hope that by working hard I can
    benefit the world at large. I hope to do that through excellent
    service.</p>
