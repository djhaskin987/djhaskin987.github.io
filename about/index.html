    <p>I have a gorgeous wife and four kids: three daughters and one son.  I
    enjoy knitting, biking, reading articles, and programming in Clojure.</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m really good at solving problems involving unfamiliar technologies.
    Often when building or deploying software, the devil is often in the
    details. I am good at clearing away the obstacles surrounding the release
    of a product and creating a maintainable, scalable pipeline so that the
    product can move through to production or release.</p>
    <p>I am a deep thinker. I like getting things done the right way, but more
    especially getting things done with the right support. I understand that
    technical work is not done in a vacumm, but is intimately connected with
    the people problems at work.</p>
    <p>I am self-motivated and I work hard. I am also a solid team player,
    willing to help newer team members ramp up and also to serve as a solid
    resource for my teammates who are more experienced. I really appreciate
    direction and mentoring from good leaders. I am passionate for contributing
    to group efforts and doing my part for the win.</p>
    <p>I like taking pride in my work and hope that by working hard I can
    benefit the world at large. I hope to do that through excellent
    service.</p>
